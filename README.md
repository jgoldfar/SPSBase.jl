This is the repo I use as a shell for other work related projects and their repositories.

### What is this repository for? ###

* Notes
* Reproducibility of my history and previous results

### How do I get set up? ###

* The biggest dependency for this repo is TeXLive for the TeX files
* For subrepos, we use (variously) Julia, MATLAB, C and libraries, R, PHP, Python, and many others.
* For syncing binary files, we use [Bittorrent Sync](http://www.getsync.com). See the downloads for our IgnoreList file; the mercurial repo directories should only sync once (!) otherwise you get repo corruption.
